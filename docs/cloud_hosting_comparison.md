- Can become expensive with scale

**Pricing:**
- No additional charge for Elastic Beanstalk
- Pay only for AWS resources used (EC2, S3, etc.)
- EC2 instances start around $10/month for t3.micro

### 4. Render
**Description:** Modern cloud platform for hosting web services, static sites, and databases.

**Pros:**
- Very simple deployment process
- Automatic HTTPS

- Less extensive documentation compared to AWS

**Pricing:**
- Free tier for web services (with limitations)
- Individual web services: $7/month
- MongoDB databases: $20/month (starter)

## Recommendation

Based on the requirements and comparison, here are the recommendations:

### For Development/Testing:
**Render** offers the best balance of simplicity, features, and cost for development and testing environments. The free tier is suitable for initial setup and testing.

### For Production:
**DigitalOcean Droplets** provide the best value for a production environment, offering good performance, reliability, and cost-effectiveness. The $4/month basic droplet with a separate MongoDB instance would be sufficient to start, with easy scaling options as needed.

### Alternative for Production:
If managed services are preferred to reduce operational overhead, **Render** offers a good balance of simplicity and features at a reasonable price point, especially for teams migrating from Heroku.

## Next Steps
1. Select the appropriate hosting platform based on the above recommendations
2. Set up the server environment
3. Deploy the application
4. Configure domain and SSL
5. Test the deployment
6. Provide access details to users
