## Integration Approach

1. **Data Flow**:
   - Voiceform collects voice/video responses and handles initial transcription
   - Voice recordings are processed through Hume AI's EVI API for emotion analysis
   - Transcripts and emotion data are analyzed using Gemini API for deeper insights
   - Results are stored in Airtable
   - Insight7 connects to Airtable via API for visualization and reporting

2. **Automation**:
   - Create Python scripts to automate the data flow between components
   - Use Airtable automations to trigger analysis workflows
   - Set up scheduled processing to minimize manual intervention
   - Develop templates for standard analysis and reporting

3. **Implementation Phases**:
   - Phase 1: Set up Voiceform and create interview templates
   - Phase 2: Implement Hume AI integration for emotion analysis
   - Phase 3: Set up Airtable base and data structure
   - Phase 4: Integrate Gemini API for advanced text analysis
   - Phase 5: Connect to Insight7 for visualization

## Cost Breakdown

| Component | Monthly Cost Estimate |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Voiceform | $0-200 (starting with free tier) |
| Hume AI | $50-150 (based on volume, after free credit) |
| Gemini API | $50-150 (based on volume) |
| Airtable | $20-26 (Team plan + optional AI add-on) |
| Insight7 | $0-100 (starting with free tier) |
| **Total** | **$120-626** |

This approach keeps the total cost well below your $1000/month budget, even when scaling up from free tiers, leaving room for additional tools or increased usage as needed.

## Time Efficiency

This streamlined stack is designed to minimize your daily time commitment:

1. **Setup Time**: 
   - Initial setup: 10-12 hours (one-time)
   - Template creation: 4-6 hours (one-time)

2. **Ongoing Time Per Project**:
   - Project setup: 15-30 minutes
   - Monitoring and quality control: 30-45 minutes
   - Results review and refinement: 45-60 minutes

With this approach, each client project should require less than 2 hours of your time, meeting your daily time constraint.
