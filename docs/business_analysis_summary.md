- Further Opportunities For
AI Enhancement
- Senior leaders can be hard to reach and time-poor. Our AI-moderated voice surveys are a breeze to complete and provide rich insights into the needs, hopes, 
and worries of key stakeholders.
- Full, in-depth data reviews can be resource intensive and result in loss of focus. AI can help speed up initial review and classification helps us focus our time and attention to the documents and data points that 
really matter.
- For strategy work to be useful, end users must build an intuitive understanding of them. Interactive personas anchored in the real data is one of many ways 
AI can bring the data 
to life.
- AI offers unprecedented opportunities to make consumer research faster, deeper, and more efficient, like Emotion Recognition or Qualitative Simulations . Jade Kite has been at the forefront of AI innovation since 2019.

- AI Voice Analysis
- What you need: To know how consumers truly feel about a subject, but traditional methods are slow and can be biased.
What it is: A solution to accurately measure how people subconsciously feel, and compare it to what they are saying.  
Why it works: Uses an AI model on over 36,000 hours of human voice to distill subconscious information using only tone of voice with over 90% accuracy, regardless of language or demographics.
- Prioritize with confidence
Emotional associations drive behavior. 
Get stronger strategic prioritization by analyzing both emotional and conscious (stated) response.

Reliable results
Accesses the subconscious and bypasses participant’s ability to filter their answers. 
Easy to adopt
Can be added to any qualitative sensory research method. Stop relying on consumer self-reporting. 

Make sense through intensity
Voice AI pinpoints the exact emotional response in the moment – even before the subjects are conscious of it.

**Slide 31: **

- Powerful analytics reveal which answers have deep roots vs. surface level feeling.
- When making a decision, some options may seem like the easy choice for the uninformed, whereas the experts in the room see things differently. 

Because uninformed opinions are held with less strength, MirAI analytics reveal how the initial breakdown of opinions (similar to a survey result) shifts as the group interacts.
- MIRAI FOR FUTURE PREDICTION
- In the example above about a new type of snack packaging, the relatively optimistic opinion of “consumers will use it alongside regular packaging” initially held 35% of the support (A). 

But after a few seconds of interaction, this support transferred to “They might try it on some occasions”, a more realistic view (B). 

The same happened to the extreme “They will never even try it”, which initially held 12% of support but wasn’t realistic.

- Powerful analytics reveal which answers have deep roots vs. surface level feeling.
- When making a decision, some options may seem like the easy choice for the uninformed, whereas the experts in the room see things differently. 

Because uninformed opinions are held with less strength, MirAI analytics reveal how the initial breakdown of opinions (similar to a survey result) shifts as the group interacts.
- MIRAI FOR FUTURE PREDICTION
- In the example above about a new type of snack packaging, the relatively optimistic opinion of “consumers will use it alongside regular packaging” initially held 35% of the support (A). 

But after a few seconds of interaction, this support transferred to “They might try it on some occasions”, a more realistic view (B). 

The same happened to the extreme “They will never even try it”, which initially held 12% of support but wasn’t realistic.

AI Enhancement
- Senior leaders can be hard to reach and time-poor. Our AI-moderated voice surveys are a breeze to complete and provide rich insights into the needs, hopes, 
and worries of key stakeholders.
- Full, in-depth data reviews can be resource intensive and result in loss of focus. AI can help speed up initial review and classification helps us focus our time and attention to the documents and data points that 
really matter.
- For strategy work to be useful, end users must build an intuitive understanding of them. Interactive personas anchored in the real data is one of many ways 
AI can bring the data 
to life.
- AI offers unprecedented opportunities to make consumer research faster, deeper, and more efficient, like Emotion Recognition or Qualitative Simulations . Jade Kite has been at the forefront of AI innovation since 2019.

**Slide 11: **

- Generative AI as a predicter of consumer responses
- NOTE ON GEN AI INSIGHTS
- Synthetic Data and Synthetic Participants can now deliver highly accurate approximation of what is most likely to happen in research. 

But it can’t give us the unexpected: Sudden changes in consumer attitudes, rapidly evolving trends, or responses to recent market changes. 

For this reason, we always recommend using GenAI as a pre-test, to streamline and accelerate organic research with real-world consumers.

**Slide 12: **

- OUR SOLUTIONS

**Slide 29: **

- INTRODUCING | MIRAI
- Using purely behavioral methods, MirAI enables a group of users to collaborate as a single organism, consistently producing far more impactful results than any other conventional decision-making or future-forecasting models.
- MirAI uses fast consensus to provide a clear path forward

**Slide 30: **

- INTRODUCING | MIRAI
- MirAI uses fast consensus to provide a clear path forward
- Using purely behavioral methods, MirAI enables a group of users to collaborate as a single organism, consistently producing far more impactful results than any other conventional decision-making or future-forecasting models.

**Slide 31: **

- Powerful analytics reveal which answers have deep roots vs. surface level feeling.
- When making a decision, some options may seem like the easy choice for the uninformed, whereas the experts in the room see things differently. 

Because uninformed opinions are held with less strength, MirAI analytics reveal how the initial breakdown of opinions (similar to a survey result) shifts as the group interacts.
- MIRAI FOR FUTURE PREDICTION
- In the example above about a new type of snack packaging, the relatively optimistic opinion of “consumers will use it alongside regular packaging” initially held 35% of the support (A). 

But after a few seconds of interaction, this support transferred to “They might try it on some occasions”, a more realistic view (B). 

The same happened to the extreme “They will never even try it”, which initially held 12% of support but wasn’t realistic.

- MirAI delivers fast turnarounds, deep insight and measurable results for confident decision-making
- If you are looking for qual level insights with quant level certainty, you’re in the right place.
- WHY MIRAI
- Certainty & Depth
- Follow up open-ended questions and real time interviews allows for depth of understanding and insight to help uncover nuance and drive actionable recommendations.
- Gamified
Engagement
- MirAI format requires constant engagement from participants. Those less engaged have less impact on the final result.
- Robustness Through Consensus
- Questionnaires and interviews can only reveal individual participant’s attitude. MirAI recognizes that groupthink impacts social decisions and forces consensus for highly robust results.
- Truth fromBehavior
- Using a gamified, timed response encourages users to activate their system 1 thinking that comes from instinct, not post-rationalization.

- Powerful analytics reveal which answers have deep roots vs. surface level feeling.
- When making a decision, some options may seem like the easy choice for the uninformed, whereas the experts in the room see things differently. 

Because uninformed opinions are held with less strength, MirAI analytics reveal how the initial breakdown of opinions (similar to a survey result) shifts as the group interacts.
- MIRAI FOR FUTURE PREDICTION
- In the example above about a new type of snack packaging, the relatively optimistic opinion of “consumers will use it alongside regular packaging” initially held 35% of the support (A). 

But after a few seconds of interaction, this support transferred to “They might try it on some occasions”, a more realistic view (B). 

The same happened to the extreme “They will never even try it”, which initially held 12% of support but wasn’t realistic.
